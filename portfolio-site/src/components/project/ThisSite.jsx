        This website is summer project that I made to show off all of the exciting things that I have
        been able to do throughtout studing computer engineering journey. I decided to use React to build this 
        website because I wanted to learn something new from my previous website that
        was made with Django. Web development is not my main focus so I have kept this site fairly simple, but 
        I still hope this this shows my abaility to learn skills outside of the class.
